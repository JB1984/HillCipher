# HillCipher
Attempt to create a Python program that will encode and decode using Hill Cipher technique.

I am using the attached HillCipherText PDF to build this program off of. It is a really good reference to understand the steps required to encode and decode a Hill cipher. I do not know the original author of the text so I cannot cite it but please let me know if you know so I can actually put a link to their website instead of having it added as an attachment.
